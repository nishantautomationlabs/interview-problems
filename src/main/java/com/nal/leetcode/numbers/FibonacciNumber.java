 * 509. Fibonacci Number
 * The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
 * F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1
 * F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1.
 * Given N, calculate F(N).
