 * 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
 * Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
 * (i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
 * Find the minimum element.
 * You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [3,4,5,1,2]
 * Output: 1
