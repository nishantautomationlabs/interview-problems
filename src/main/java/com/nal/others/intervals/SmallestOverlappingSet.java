 * There are multiple intervals which may or may overlap with each other. Find a minimum subset of the intervals,
 * so that for every interval that is not included in the subset, it will find at least 1 interval in the subset
 * that will overlap with it.
 * Consider intervals: [0,2], [1,4], [3,10], [5, 6], [7,8], [9, 10].
 * A minimum subset should have 2 intervals: [3, 10] plus either [0, 2] or [1, 4].
 *
 * Solution: Find the job x in A which has the minimal end time (t).
 * From all jobs whose start time is less than t: pick the job j with the maximum end time.
 * Add j to the output set.
 * Remove all jobs which overlap j from A.
 * Repeat 1-4 until A is empty.
